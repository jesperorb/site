This spring I started to commute a bit between Stockholm and Uppsala. As this section of railway is notoriously riddled with delays and cancelled trains I wanted an app that displays the trafic info for the trains running (or not running).

So I built small site for it: **[Sthlm-Uppsala](https://sthlm-uppsala.vercel.app/)**.

It features a refresh button so you can easily get the lastest info and a button to change the direction. It also has a checkbox so you can toggle to only display trains that run on the commuter card "Movingo".

The app is built with Svelte and TypeScript.
